# <Factorial Multithreading>

## Description
- Conducted in COSC420-01 Distributed and Parallel Computing at St. Mary's College of Southern Maryland.
- The user input should be in the form of an integer.
- Once you receive the integer, calculate the factorial.
- Print the answer to the console.
- You can wrap this functionality in a forever loop ("while True: take input"), or try to match the style of the PrintTime thread.
- Expected Output: No matter how long the user waits to input a number, the timestamp should continuously print to the console

- I learned how to further apply knowledge of threading to create a multithreaded program.
